![Multiple-3x2-top](/assets/images/Multiple-3x2-top.png)

Basic passive multiple, with a total of 3 inputs.

Each input is routed to 2 outputs.

All the sections "cascade" onto one another, so if you plug only input 1, you'll get that signal on all the 6 ouputs

## Schematics

## BoM

It is pretty straitforward, you will need 9 jack sockets, 9 Thonkiconns to be exact. 

[See bom](/assets/bom/Multiple-3x2_V1.0--iBoM.html)

## Build Informations

:warning: Fisrt place all the jack sockets, put in place the front panel, then fasten all jacks to it. Once this is done, you can solder them.
