# Bleep Sound Eurorack modules

## Not all projects are finished or even perfect, use at your own risks.

### Filters:

- MS20-VCF
    - MS-20 clones built around the LM13700 chip
    - :heavy_check_mark: [Simple MS20 VCF](https://github.com/BleepSound/ms20-vcf-simple):
        - 1 LM13700 filter with a Low pass or High pass switch with CV for cutoff
        - Based on barton's version : ([link](https://www.bartonmusicalcircuits.com/synthstuff.html#analog))
    - :heavy_check_mark: [Double MS20-VCF](https://github.com/BleepSound/ms20-vcf-double)
        - 2 filters in one, each with Low pass or High pass with a possibility to bridge them and get a band pass filter with CV for cutoff
        - Based on barton's version ([link](https://www.bartonmusicalcircuits.com/synthstuff.html#analog))

### Mixers:

- :heavy_check_mark: [Basic DC mixer](https://github.com/BleepSound/basic-mixer-dc)
    - 4 channel active mixer with mute option with DC coupling (Audio+CV)

### Multiple:

- :heavy_check_mark: [3x2 multiple](https://github.com/BleepSound/multiple-3x2)
    - 3x2 passive multiple (3 inputs to 2 output each)
    - cascade the first input to all outputs if no other input is plugged in

### VCOs:

- :heavy_check_mark: [RP2040 chord VCO](https://github.com/BleepSound/rp2040-chord-vco)
    - VCO clone, originally made by HAGIWO ([link](https://note.com/solder_state/n/n64b91a171218) in japanese)
    - RP2040 chord VCO clone in SMD.
    - 5-polyphonic Chord VCO module. There are 8 types of tones. With a built-in quantizer and automatic harmonics function, if you input a suitable CV, it will play a nice chord progression. 
- :warning: [CD40106-VCO](https://github.com/BleepSound/cd40106_vco)
    - CD40106 saw core oscillator based on Moritz Klein version (https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/diy-kits-1/edu-diy-vco/)
        - 4 waveforms
            - Saw
            - Square with PWM control
            - Triangle
            - Sine
        - 5 octave switch
        - 1v/oct CV, FM CV and PWM CV.
        - Sync input
        - Extender pins to future Sub octave extender

### ADSRs:

- :warning: [Basic ADSR](https://github.com/BleepSound/basic_adsr)
    - Basic ADSR based on Ren√© Schmitz [Fastest envelope in the West](https://www.schmitzbits.de/adsr.html)
    - All you need in an ADSR
    - Switch to have 2 different time constants for the ADSR

### Power delivery:

-  :heavy_check_mark:  [Distribution board](https://github.com/BleepSound/distribution_board)
    - Basic Eurorack PSU distribution board, with 12 IDC headers.
-  :warning:  [USB distribution board](https://github.com/BleepSound/usb-distrib)
    - Double USB receptacle to power 5V usb devices out of your eurorack case.

| Symbol | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Fully designed, debugged, tested, and verified. |
| :warning: | Fully designed but not tested. There is a high chance this won't work first try. |
| :exclamation: | Unfinished, messy design. Do not use, for reference or otherwise. |

*Cheers to @Sonosus for the labeling idea*
